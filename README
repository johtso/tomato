Simple python script to backup the config from my Tomato router
---------------------------------------------------------------

I borrowed the idea from Gregg Hansen's excellent bash script:

    http://beekl.es/5w

and rewrote it in python. Gregg's script was for backing up a farm of tomato
routers, my script just does a single device.

Using it
--------

You will require:

* python-yaml (apt-get install python-yaml on Ubuntu-ish systems, there's
  presumably a python egg too)
* https enabled on your router

Then it's very simple, cp config/config.yaml-sample to config/config.yaml and
fill in the details, then run ./backup.py
